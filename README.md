# learning algorithms, data structures, and design patterns

This is just a place for me to reaquaint myself with the theory and practice of computer science.

Also everything is in Python, because it's a langauge I want to get good at.

All code was written from scratch.

## Design Patterns

These come from *Head First Design Patterns*, which is all Java.

## Algorithms

These come from *Algorithms in a Nutshell, 2nd edition*. The code in the book is mostly Java with scattered Python showers.

## Learn Python the Hard Way

This is exactly what is sounds like. See http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ .
