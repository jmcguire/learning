# learning algorithms, data structures, and design patterns

This is just a place for me to reaquaint myself with the theory and practice of computer science.

Also everything is in Python, because it's a langauge I want to get good at.

All code was written from scratch.

## Design Patterns

These come from *Head First Design Patterns*.

That book is written for Java, which makes some of the Python interpretations a bit wonkey. The top two culprits is no type constraints and no class interfaces. I've followed the code as accurately as I can, but the "interfaces" are more "hints of what is expected" than anything binding.

I suspect these "problems" would be found in all higher-level interpreted languages, but I can only confirm it for Python and Perl.

(When I first read the GoF's *Design Patterns* I dismissed most of it as a coverup for the unforunate parts of C++'s object design. That was definitely unfair, since the strongest benefits of Design Patterns come from managing huge code bases, a fact that I missed with all the small examples. But I would still love a book on design patterns that is built for modern interpretted languages, with duck-typing and no compile-time type checking.)

## Algorithms

These come from *Algorithms in a Nutshell, 2nd edition*. The code in it is mostly Java, with some Python. Even when given a chunk of Python code I still wrote my code from scratch.
