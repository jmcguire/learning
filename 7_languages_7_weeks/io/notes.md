# Io

 - Everything is an object.
 - everything is messages and recievers.

## Messages

`reciever message` - pass the message tot he reciever


## Objects

:Prototype Objects: Objects are created by cloning, not by classes. There are no classes.

Objects keep track of what it was cloned from. If it can't respond to a message, it passed the message to it's ancestor.

Objects have slots. Each slot can hold an object. (And since everything is an object, a lost can hold anything.)


    Vehicle := Object clone # pass the message `clone` to `Object`, and assign it to `Vehicle`
    Vehicle description := "something that moves" # create a new slot, and assign it a string
    Vehicle description = "something that moves you" # reassign a slot


### Nomenclature

`InitialCapsObject := AnotherObject` - a new type of AnotherObject
`lowercaseobject := AnotherObject` - an "instance" (kinda) of AnotherObject, not a new type


### Common messages for objects


    Foo slotNames       # get all slots for this object (not its ancestors)
    Foo type             # get the type of this object. usually its name
    Foo getSlot("name") # get the object in this slot (will go to the ancestors)
    Foo proto           # get the prototype (ancestor) information


### Misc

To see all the objects, call `Lobby`.

To make a singleton:

    Highlander := Object clone
    Highlander clone := Highlanger


## Methods

    method("vroom" prinln) # create a method that prints "vroom" with a newline

## Lists

    list("one", "two", 3)

Messages on a list

    list (1,2,3) average
    list (1,2,3) sum
    list (1,2,3) at(n) # n is a number
    list (1,2,3) append(foo)
    list (1,2,3) pop
    list (1,2,3) prepend(foo)
    list (1,2,3) isEmpty

## Maps

    foo := Map clone

Messages on a map

    foo atPut("key", "value")
    foo at("key")
    foo asObject # return the keys and values
    foo asList # a list of lists, where each inner list is (key, value)
    foo keys
    foo size # number of keys

## Logic

0 is true
"" (the empty list) is true
