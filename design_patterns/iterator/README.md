# Iterator

## Problem

We have two different collections, on based on arrays and one based on linked lists. We need to work with both of them at the same time.

(Note: This is a bad example of this type of problem for Python, because Python doesn't have arrays. The general concepts-learned are sound, but we could really use a different example.)

## Solution 1

Code two different handling techniques into every piece of code that uses them.

## Iterator Pattern

Create an iterator for both collections. All iterators should use a common interface, so all iterators are compatible.

## OO Principle
